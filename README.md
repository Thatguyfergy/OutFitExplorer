# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

OutFit Explorer is a web application designed to promote healthy living by encouraging individuals to explore outdoor activities. Our platform aims to inspire users to embrace an active lifestyle through outdoor recreation. Whether you're a seasoned outdoor enthusiast or just starting your fitness journey, OutFit Explorer provides the tools and resources to help you make the most of your outdoor adventures.

With OutFit Explorer's intuitive interface, you can easily locate nearby parks, complete with user reviews to help you choose the perfect spot. Need some inspiration for exercises? OutFit Explorer offers exercise suggestions that you can tailor to your fitness level and interests.

But that's not all. OutFit Explorer goes beyond just finding the right park and exercises. With our integrated weather forecast feature, you can plan your outdoor activities with confidence, knowing what to expect from Mother Nature.

And here's where it gets even better. OutFit Explorer rewards you for your outdoor adventures through our innovative GPS tracking system. By verifying your location at the park, you can earn rewards and incentives to keep you motivated and engaged in your healthy lifestyle journey.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
